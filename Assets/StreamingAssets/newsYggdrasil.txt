Expect a visit from Illian, our handy-dandy, info-dump Raven to pay you a visit with a new quest line, which will lead you to clues about where this dark monster-beast lives, and how to defeat it!

New Birch Trees, Red Mushrooms, and Puffy Dandelions have been added to the list of crafting material. <mark=#AEDEFB60>Collect these to unlock new crafting recipes.</mark>

A brand new, silent enemie called Shadoe, also sneaks around, threatening to drag you into the darkness to consume you. Make a home with light quickly, or risk losing yourself forever..."

Tired of playing along with your friends, or of them taking all the materials you spent your time gathering?

~:5|0|We’re sad to say that unfortunately this means that any map you have WITHOUT PVP will have to remain that way. Yes, that means we haven’t created a way to change your current servers to PVP; You need to create a brand new save file if you want to switch.  We’re hoping in the near future to change this so you can freely swap between friendly and PVP on any saved file you have."
