@:|0|PockyDaze|WOW. Talk about intense. 
@:|0|PockyDaze|It's definitely worth the money though.
*:|0|1|2|I can't believe we made it out alive! My heart is pounding...|No sweat. These survival games aren't all they're cracked up to be.
@:|1|PockyDaze|They had me going there for a minute.|P
@:|2|PockyDaze|You are one tough human, <pnm>.
@:|0|PockyDaze|It's actually a lot more fun than I realised it would be.
@:|0|PockyDaze|The trailers made it sound like it'd be dark, but this is more than I bargained for. 
@:|0|PockyDaze|Although, I have to admit, I didn't expect the homes to be something I could design.
@:|0|PockyDaze|I just thought they'd be for shelter and that would really be it.
*:|0|1|2|I love playing around with in-game houses. It's so relaxing.|Housing isn't really that interesting... I should really work on sprucing up my own.
@:|1|PockyDaze|There's just something cool about desiging a fantasy house. Makes me reconsider watching all those dumb housing reality tv shows!
@:|2|PockyDaze|That's true. Although... my walls are covered with posters and bulletin boards.
@:|0|PockyDaze|We just started the game, but it looks like there're already some new updates. 
@:|0|PockyDaze|Looks like there's a new boss we have to run away from, haha. 
@:|0|PockyDaze|(And, speaking of, looks like it drops some nice loot for our houses)
@:|0|PockyDaze|Oh, and some spooky night-time monsters to keep us on our toes.
@:|0|PockyDaze|They announced a ton of stuff, damn.
*:|0|1|2|I'd hate to run into those mobs while gathering supplies though. Makes me jump out of my skin!|It looks like we joined at the right time for PVP though!
@:|1|PockyDaze|Thankfully the game is pretty kind there and made them neutral, but they make me jump too. XP
@:|2|PockyDaze|Yeah! As if the monsters, crafting, and all around surviving wasn't hard enough! X3|P
@:|0|PockyDaze|I like that we can play together.
@:|0|PockyDaze|This kind of game is usually more fun with other friends struggling alongside you.
@:|0|PockyDaze|Hopefully we don't run into Shadoe or Divangr until we're stronger though. 
*:|0|1|2|Live together, die together!|Or when there's a bear chasing us, I just have to outrun you. :3
@:|1|PockyDaze|Homies protect their homies!|P
@:|1|PockyDaze|Don't worry, I'll protect you. 
@:|1|PockyDaze|After all, I need someone to gather wood. :P
@:|2|PockyDaze|So that's how it's going to be, eh?
@:|2|PockyDaze|Just so you know, if danger rears its ugly head, I'm tripping you and running OUT.
@:|2|PockyDaze|Fight, Flight, Freeze, and Self-Preservation. >:3
@:|0|PockyDaze|But seriously, this game has a lot of really fun elements to it.
@:|0|PockyDaze|It kinda feels like if CaveCreate didn't just have zombies running around, but tons of other beasties. 
@:|0|PockyDaze|I wonder what the new supplies are going to make. 
@:|0|PockyDaze|Since we haven't fully unlocked all the crafting, I'll probably have to look it up...
@:|0|PockyDaze|I bet we can make great stuff if we work together. 
*:|0|1|2|Give me a shopping list, and I'll get everything we need!|I prefer to kill stuff than forage or craft. I'll leave that up to you.
@:|1|PockyDaze|Really? I'll make a super dooper long list! I'll hold you to it!|P
@:|1|PockyDaze|Jk jk. We can split the work, 50/50. 
@:|1|PockyDaze|It's nice to finally meet someone who can enjoy crafting. 
@:|2|PockyDaze|Well, there are some pelts and stuff that enemies drop.
@:|2|PockyDaze|I'll bug you about those when I need to craft us some new clothes or armor. 
@:|2|PockyDaze|That leaves me to forage for the rest of it though. 
@:|0|PockyDaze|I think I need a break from Yggdrasil for tonight. 
@:|0|PockyDaze|I've been kinda putting off watching this anime my friend suggested. 
@:|0|PockyDaze|It's like a Japanese version of Osmosis Smith where there're all these cells doing work inside our bodies.
@:|0|PockyDaze|Not sure if I'll like it, but they keep saying it's fantastic. 
@:|0|PockyDaze|Do you watch anime?
@:|0|PockyDaze|I bet you watch all those really cutesy slice of life ones.
*:|0|1|2|I love anime! And yes, I do like those 'cutesy slice of life' ones.|Anime is good if you're in the mood for it. I like the gorey, dark ones though. 
@:|1|PockyDaze|lol nice! I really like them too. 
@:|1|PockyDaze|The slice of life comedies are the best!
@:|2|PockyDaze|I totally didn't have you pegged for the darker stuff.
@:|2|PockyDaze|No wonder you took an interest in Yggdrasil xP
@:|0|PockyDaze|But since we're on the topic, how do you feel about cosplay?
@:|0|PockyDaze|I've been to a bunch of cons.
@:|0|PockyDaze|Comic con, anime con, expos. There are tons of really talented people there.
*:|0|1|2|I've always wanted to cosplay! I'm just not confident enough.|Nah, cosplay doesn't really interest me. Fantasy crushes only tyvm.
@:|1|PockyDaze|Couples do cosplay sometimes.|P
@:|1|PockyDaze|Maybe we can cosplay something together.
@:|1|PockyDaze|It's always a lot more fun cosplaying with someone else than alone.
@:|2|PockyDaze|lol, but that's what's so great about cosplay!
@:|2|PockyDaze|They're bringing your fantasy crushes to life!
@:|2|PockyDaze|Well, doesn't matter anyway. I just think it's fun.
@:|0|PockyDaze|I'm about to pass out right now. 
@:|0|PockyDaze|Is my heart finally giving out after the game? D:
@:|0|PockyDaze|jk!~ 
@:|0|PockyDaze|I think all these late nights are finally catching up to me. 
@:|0|PockyDaze|I better get to sleep and wake up tomorrow.
@:|0|PockyDaze|I think Corn really wanted to play something together.
@:|0|PockyDaze|I dunno if I feel up to it...
@:|0|PockyDaze|Let's chat tomorrow, okay? 
@:|0|PockyDaze|G'night!
@:|0|PockyDaze|...don't let the Shadoe bite... >:3
*:|*|1|2|3|
@:|1|PockyDaze|Also, I don't take many pics, but...
@:|1|PockyDaze|*Image*
@:|1|PockyDaze|I thought it'd be fun to take a quick selfie. 
@:|1|PockyDaze|Think it could be my new profile picture?
@:|1|PockyDaze|...nevermind. I like my old one more. XD
@:|2|PockyDaze|Check out Jiji! Look at her face. <3
@:|2|PockyDaze|*Image*
@:|2|PockyDaze|This cat is so talkative.
@:|2|PockyDaze|Maybe you can hear her when we're on chat.
@:|2|PockyDaze|Anyway, I'm passing out. Night!
@:|3|PockyDaze|I bet you wouldn't expect to see this, but...
@:|3|PockyDaze|*Image*
@:|3|PockyDaze|Like I said, I like to cosplay. And I felt pretty good about this one.
@:|3|PockyDaze|Oh, and you can see my giant Teddy Bear too.
@:|3|PockyDaze|Of course he has a name. 
@:|3|PockyDaze|It's Sir Bearington III. And you have to say it with as posh an accent as you can.
@:|3|PockyDaze|Alright, lol. Night.
