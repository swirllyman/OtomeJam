CanOfCorn#1122	Hey @CanOfCorn, welcome to The Server!
PockyDaze#0120	Hey @PockyDaze, welcome to The Server!
@:|CanOfCorn|Yo, that game was ridiculous.
@:|PockyDaze|Yeah, I thought we'd lose for sure at the end...
@:|CanOfCorn|Nah, we had that one. <player's name> came in clutch!
@:|PockyDaze|Yeah, <player's pronoun> really saved us in that last fight.
@:|CanOfCorn|How long you been playing for, <player's name>?
*:|I just started...|I've been playing for a while now.
A|PockyDaze|Jeez you're better than me already.
B|PockyDaze|Lol maybe you could teach me a thing or two sometime.
?/
@:|CanOfCorn|Ye <player's pronoun> got you beat, bro.
@:|PockyDaze|Ehhh... I just suck at this kind of game tbh.
*:|Don't sell yourself short :(|Just practice and play more 4hed :P
A|CanOfCorn|If you tell him that, he'll never get better.
A|PockyDaze|Pfft thanks.
B|CanOfCorn|LOLOL got you there.
B|PockyDaze|Oof.
?/
@:|CanOfCorn|Do you usually play top, Pocky?
@:|PockyDaze|Yeah, I prefer it up there. Solo-laning is more my style.
@:|CanOfCorn|Nice. I started in mid, but I prefer ADC. 
@:|CanOfCorn|Especially if I have a competent support.
@:|PockyDaze|True. It's hard to do anything in top lane without a good jungler.
@:|CanOfCorn|HBU <player's name>? What do you main?
*:|I like support. Duoing with an ADC is fun.|I like jungle. Ganking lanes is where it's at.
A|CanOfCorn|Sweet. We should ranked duo sometime or something ;P
B|PockyDaze|That's cool. Your ganks did help me out a bit.
@:|CanOfCorn|Shit, well. My other friends are hitting me up to play Bash Bros...
@:|CanOfCorn|But, we should all play together again some time.
@:|PockyDaze|Yeah I'd be down.
*:|Totally, I love Alliance of Myth.|Maybe. I only play Alliance of Myth with a group.
A|CanOfCorn|Sick :D Can't wait to play more... tomorrow, maybe?
A|PockyDaze|Sure, just hit me up. I'm usually online.
B|CanOfCorn|Same! I prefer gaming with friends.
B|PockyDaze|I'm usually solo gaming, so it's whatever for me.
?/
@:|CanOfCorn|Anyways. I'll catch you guys later.
@:|PockyDaze|Alright. I think I'm gonna go play some Flows!
@:|CanOfCorn|Nice! That's that rhythm game, right?
@:|PockyDaze|Yeah. I like to vibe to the music. It's playable with friends too, but I hardly do...
@:|PockyDaze|I think I heard Bash Bros is an ultimate showdown, fighter type?
@:|CanOfCorn|Ye. I like it cos I can be so random, and I can play with my irl friends, too.
@:|CanOfCorn|<player's name>, if you want to join, we have space.
@:|PockyDaze|I could also show you Flows! if you're interested in that.

*:|Join Bash Bros Server|Join Flows! Server
A|CanOfCorn|Woo! I'll see you in there!
