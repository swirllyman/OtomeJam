@:|0|Server Bot|PockyDaze#0120	Hey @PockyDaze, welcome to The Server!
@:|0|CanOfCorn|Yo, that game was ridiculous.
@:|0|PockyDaze|Yeah, I thought we'd lose for sure at the end...
@:|0|CanOfCorn|Nah, we had that one. <pnm> came in clutch!
@:|0|PockyDaze|Yeah, <he/she/they> really saved us in that last fight.
@:|0|CanOfCorn|How long you been playing for, <pnm>?
*:|0|1|2|I just started...|I've been playing for a while now.
@:|1|PockyDaze|Jeez you're better than me already.
@:|2|PockyDaze|Lol maybe you could teach me a thing or two sometime.
@:|0|CanOfCorn|Ye <he/she/they> got you beat, bro.
@:|0|PockyDaze|Ehhh... I just suck at this kind of game tbh.
*:|0|1|2|Don't sell yourself short :(|Just practice and play more 4hed :P
@:|1|CanOfCorn|If you tell him that, he'll never get better.
@:|1|PockyDaze|Pfft thanks.
@:|2|CanOfCorn|LOLOL got you there.
@:|2|PockyDaze|Oof.
@:|0|CanOfCorn|Do you usually play top, Pocky?
@:|0|PockyDaze|Yeah, I prefer it up there. Solo-laning is more my style.
@:|0|CanOfCorn|Nice. I started in mid, but I prefer ADC. 
@:|0|CanOfCorn|Especially if I have a competent support.
@:|0|PockyDaze|True. It's hard to do anything in top lane without a good jungler.
@:|0|CanOfCorn|HBU <pnm>? What do you main?
*:|0|1|2|I like support. Duoing with an ADC is fun.|I like jungle. Ganking lanes is where it's at.
@:|1|CanOfCorn|Sweet. We should ranked duo sometime or something ;P
@:|2|PockyDaze|That's cool. Your ganks did help me out a bit.
@:|0|CanOfCorn|Shit, well. My other friends are hitting me up to play Bash Bros...
@:|0|CanOfCorn|But, we should all play together again some time.
@:|0|PockyDaze|Yeah I'd be down.
*:|0|1|2|Totally, I love Alliance of Myth.|Maybe. I only play Alliance of Myth with a group.
@:|1|CanOfCorn|Sick :D Can't wait to play more... tomorrow, maybe?
@:|1|PockyDaze|Sure, just hit me up. I'm usually online.
@:|2|CanOfCorn|Same! I prefer gaming with friends.
@:|2|PockyDaze|I'm usually solo gaming, so it's whatever for me.
@:|0|CanOfCorn|Anyways. I'll catch you guys later.
@:|0|PockyDaze|Alright. I think I'm gonna go play some Flows!
@:|0|CanOfCorn|Nice! That's that rhythm game, right?
@:|0|PockyDaze|Yeah. I like to vibe to the music. It's playable with friends too, but I hardly do...
@:|0|PockyDaze|I think I heard Bash Bros is an ultimate showdown, fighter type?
@:|0|CanOfCorn|Ye. I like it cos I can be so random, and I can play with my irl friends, too.
@:|0|CanOfCorn|<pnm>, if you want to join, we have space.
@:|0|PockyDaze|I could also show you Flows! if you're interested in that.
