@:|0|CanOfCorn|Goood MORNINGGG!!
@:|0|PockyDaze|Remind me to turn off notification pings...
*:|0|1|2|But mornings are the best time :D|Saaame~
@:|1|CanOfCorn|I agree! Plus Bigsby won't let me sleep in...
@:|1|CanOfCorn|He needs his morning walks, despite the torrential rain outside...
@:|1|PockyDaze|Is this a grandfather or sibling or something?
@:|1|CanOfCorn|LOL no. Bigsby is my dog xD
@:|2|PockyDaze|Not a morning person either, huh <pnm>?
@:|2|PockyDaze|Once again, I stayed up waaay too late...
@:|2|CanOfCorn|What are you always doing up late anyways?
@:|2|PockyDaze|Eh... gaming or coding usually.
*:|*|1|2|cry|queen
@:|1|CanOfCorn|Oh hey, <pnm>. CtR o.o
@:|1|CanOfCorn|Did you check the news updates?
*:|1|3|4|Yeah, I'm excited for them!|No, I haven't read them yet...
@:|3|CanOfCorn|YOOO SAME.
@:|3|CanOfCorn|My friends were hitting my up early about them cos the custom game modes.
@:|3|CanOfCorn|But UniLeague is this weekend too, and I'm kinda interested in playing in it...
@:|3|CanOfCorn|Which would mean practicing with a team...
@:|4|CanOfCorn|DX CMOOON.
@:|4|CanOfCorn|You gotta get on those.
@:|4|CanOfCorn|You're reaaally missing out.
@:|4|CanOfCorn|Sigh... guess I'll just be excited for it by myself >:(
@:|3|CanOfCorn|IDK... What would you wanna do?
*:|3|5|6|I'm down for custom game modes.|I'm interested in competing in UniLeague.
@:|5|CanOfCorn|Cool I'll let my friends know :D
@:|5|CanOfCorn|I might dip out a few games to practice for UniLeague anyways :P
@:|5|CanOfCorn|Depends if I find a team to join or not.
@:|6|CanOfCorn|Oh? It might be difficult, but I think we could do it!
@:|6|CanOfCorn|I'll definitely let my friends know.
@:|6|CanOfCorn|Maybe they'll be interested in joining a team with us.
@:|5|CanOfCorn|We'll have to try out some random modes together.
@:|5|CanOfCorn|Got any ideas in mind?
*:|5|7|8|Dark mode!|UniLeague mode!
@:|7|CanOfCorn|Wait, where did you see that?|C
@:|7|CanOfCorn|LINK ME PLEASE!!
@:|8|CanOfCorn|Wait, what? x'D
@:|8|CanOfCorn|UniLeague is the competitive game mode, and not part of customs lol
@:|6|CanOfCorn|What weapon are you thinking of maining during the tournament?
@:|6|CanOfCorn|You're pretty good with melee, to be honest, but it's up to you.
*:|6|9|10|I was thinking Traps?|I was thinking a Flashlight?
@:|9|CanOfCorn|OOO yeah. That could add really good utility.|C
@:|9|CanOfCorn|We'll definitely have to find a team with good comms.
@:|10|CanOfCorn|LOL wait a second.
@:|10|CanOfCorn|Flashlights are only part of the random game mode, dork :P
@:|2|PockyDaze|Yo, <pnm>. For the Queen news came through this morning.
@:|2|PockyDaze|Did you see them?
*:|2|11|12|Of course I did!|No, I haven't read them yet...
@:|11|PockyDaze|You're keeping your finger on the pulse!
@:|11|PockyDaze|These are some big changes.
@:|11|PockyDaze|We've gotta try it out.
@:|12|PockyDaze|It's some big news, <pnm>.
@:|12|PockyDaze|You should really read the news when you log in.
@:|12|PockyDaze|I know you're in a hurry to talk to me, but...
@:|11|PockyDaze|Man, I can't decide what I'm more excited for.
*:|11|13|14|Multiplayer just got added! Let's give it a shot.|They're adding a new map!
@:|13|PockyDaze|Let's gooooo!
@:|13|PockyDaze|Now we can see how good your Paladin game is. >:3
@:|14|PockyDaze|They're literally adding in tons of content with this DLC.
@:|14|PockyDaze|And I'm sooooo down for this sci-fi addition.
@:|13PockyDaze|They did say there were a lot of bugs with it, but I didn't expect there to be THIS many. 
@:|13PockyDaze|FtQ must've rushed this out.
*:|13|15|16|Still! I'm having fun. And it's not too bad...|It's really buggy... I'm not having too much fun with it.
@:|15|PockyDaze|Yeah! Once they really get the multiplayer working, it'll be much better.|P
@:|15|PockyDaze|Maybe we can progress you through the story a little further tonight. 
@:|16|PockyDaze|It might be better if you just play alone. 
@:|16|PockyDaze|This is unplayable. 
@:|14|PockyDaze|I wonder if they're going to play around with the weapons. 
@:|14|PockyDaze|Maybe we'll have flamethrowers or lightsabers. 
*:|14|17|18|That would be so cool! What if they played around with gravity effects?|I'm not too interested in those. I kinda like old medieval weapons.
@:|17|PockyDaze|Whoa, that's a really good idea! I hope they have a gravity gun added too.|P
@:|17|PockyDaze|They should have both of us pitching ideas in the writer's room!
@:|18|PockyDaze|Well, yeah, me too.
@:|18|PockyDaze|I doubt they'd force you to use sci-fi weapons, but they're probably going to have better stats.
@:|0|PockyDaze|Ughhh okay... I'm way more tired than I expected to be...
@:|0|PockyDaze|IDK if I have enough brain power to play Alliance right now.
@:|0|CanOfCorn|BOOO WHAAAT?!
@:|0|CanOfCorn|Cmon I blew off my friends to play today.
@:|0|PockyDaze|Dx at this point, you'd have a better player than me.
@:|0|CanOfCorn|-.- alright alright.
@:|0|PockyDaze|I'd be down to play something else, if y'all want.
@:|0|CanOfCorn|Mmm what are you thinking?
@:|0|PockyDaze|Yggdrasil looks interesting, if curious.
@:|0|CanOfCorn|I think I've heard of it. Remind me what it's about?
@:|0|PockyDaze|It's an open world, survival-craft game.
@:|0|PockyDaze|And it's loosely based on Norse mythology.
@:|0|CanOfCorn|That sounds pretty cool.
@:|0|CanOfCorn|I'm not really into survival-craft, though.
@:|0|PockyDaze|Ah, I gotcha... It's like, a $20 game too.
@:|0|CanOfCorn|Yeah, I'll pass xD That's a little steep for a game I'll hardly play :P
@:|0|CanOfCorn|I'll probably just play my baseball game.
@:|0|PockyDaze|Which one?
@:|0|CanOfCorn|Double Plays. I'm short stop in my hometown team.
@:|0|CanOfCorn|I clearly don't get enough of it IRL :P
@:|0|PockyDaze|LOL yeah, I'm not much of a sports person...
@:|0|PockyDaze|Or an IRL person xD 
@:|0|PockyDaze|Leave me behind my computer desk, in my room, tyvm.
@:|0|CanOfCorn|xDD What about you, <pnm>? More of an indoor or outdoor person?
*:|0|1|2|I like being outdoors more.|I like being indoors more.
@:|1|CanOfCorn|Same! I love going to the park with Bigsby.|C
@:|1|CanOfCorn|I just dislike that feeling of being stuck indoors.
@:|2|PockyDaze|Me too lol. Especially during the summer... It's way too hot outside.|P
@:|2|PockyDaze|I'd rather soak up the AC in my room and play games lol
@:|0|PockyDaze|Well, I'mma go try out Yggdrasil.
@:|0|PockyDaze|<pnm>, if you wanna join, I'll drop the link in chat.
@:|0|CanOfCorn|Sounds good :D Hit me up if you change your mind about Alliance.
@:|0|CanOfCorn|If you're interested in that baseball game, you can also join me :3
