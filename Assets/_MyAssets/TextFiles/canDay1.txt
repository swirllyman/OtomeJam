@:|0|CanOfCorn|Sorry about my friends xD
@:|0|CanOfCorn|They can get a bit rowdy at times, but I swear they mean well...
*:|0|1|2|Yeah, they were pretty cool.|It took a little time to get used to, but it was fun.
@:|1|CanOfCorn|Sweet, I'm glad you liked them.
@:|2|CanOfCorn|That's cool. At least you had fun, right?
@:|0|CanOfCorn|I've known most of them irl for a few years.
@:|0|CanOfCorn|But there are also a few I met online through games.
@:|0|CanOfCorn|If you play more with me, maybe you'll get to know them :P
@:|0|CanOfCorn|Anyways, how did you like Bash Bros?
*:|0|1|2|It was fun. Lots of cool mechanics.|It was a little difficult to get used to the controls...
@:|1|CanOfCorn|Oh yeah! We'll have to play again so you can try some other characters.
@:|2|CanOfCorn|Ah, I see. The controls are a little strange at first.
@:|0|CanOfCorn|BTW, did you notice that News Bot in your server?
@:|0|CanOfCorn|You should check it out some time, if you have the chance.
@:|0|CanOfCorn|It'll give you some cool updates about the games you play.
@:|0|CanOfCorn|I was peeking at the news for Bash Bros actually...
@:|0|CanOfCorn|And must admit, pretty excited for new character releases :o
*:|0|1|2|Oh yeah! Nie Replica's B2 and 2A|Oh yeah! Nie Automatic's B2 and 2A
@:|1|CanOfCorn|*Nie Automatic. Replica is actually the prequel to the game :P
@:|2|CanOfCorn|Yes! I can't wait! Nie Automatic is one of my favorite games.|C
@:|0|CanOfCorn|If you're interested in the Nie series, I could stream some gameplay for you some time.
@:|0|CanOfCorn|But it's a single player game, so it might not be as fun for you...
@:|0|CanOfCorn|Up to you, though :D
*:|0|1|2|Yeah, I'd be interested in checking it out!|Nah you're right. I'd rather play more Bash Bros with you ;P
@:|1|CanOfCorn|Cool. We could totally do it whenever we're online next.
@:|1|CanOfCorn|Prob not tonight though, cos I've got some family stuff to do.
@:|1|CanOfCorn|But definitely soon :D
@:|2|CanOfCorn|LOL fair enough :P
@:|2|CanOfCorn|My friends and I play all the time.
@:|2|CanOfCorn|Just join on us whenever you want :D
@:|0|CanOfCorn|Oh...
@:|0|CanOfCorn|I also noticed that they posted some patch notes for Bash Bros.
@:|0|CanOfCorn|No wonder WOWser felt so different...
@:|0|CanOfCorn|And by different, I mean NERFED.
@:|0|CanOfCorn|Why'd they have to take my favorite character and do that :(
*:|0|1|2|It was his tenacity, wasn't it?|It was his damage, wasn't it?
@:|1|CanOfCorn|Yeah! They took like, 1.5s off the duration...|C
@:|1|CanOfCorn|Which doesn't sound like a lot.
@:|1|CanOfCorn|But it pretty long when you're fighting.
@:|2|CanOfCorn|xD that's Didley, actually.
@:|2|CanOfCorn|I played him earlier too, so it makes sense why you'd mix them up.
@:|2|CanOfCorn|But anyways, they nerfed WOWser's tenacity.
@:|0|CanOfCorn|Sadge.
@:|0|CanOfCorn|Won't stop me from playing him though :P
@:|0|CanOfCorn|I'll just have to be more aware of how long he's Unstoppable for.
@:|0|CanOfCorn|I like him cos he's tanky and hits hard.
@:|0|CanOfCorn|The Unstoppable helped cos he's also slow...
@:|0|CanOfCorn|It'll just take time getting used to I guess xD
*:|0|1|2|You got this :D|Just keep practicing, duh :P
@:|1|CanOfCorn|xD thanks for the vote of confidence.
@:|1|CanOfCorn|It's frustrating when they nerf all my favorite characters though >.<;;
@:|2|CanOfCorn|LOL HEY.
@:|2|CanOfCorn|I'm about to make you eat those words ;P
@:|0|CanOfCorn|Speaking of...
@:|0|CanOfCorn|You played some Karrin tonight, didn't you?
@:|0|CanOfCorn|What did you think? They nerfed some things in her kit too.
*:|0|1|2|Yeah, two abilities, I think.|Yeah, three abilities, I think.
@:|1|CanOfCorn|Yuuup.|C
@:|1|CanOfCorn|Sucks cos her parry into daze is a huge part of why she could put out so much damage.
@:|1|CanOfCorn|On top of that, they lowered damage to her combo scaling.
@:|2|CanOfCorn|Ah, yeah looking at the patch notes, it can be a little confusing.
@:|2|CanOfCorn|But they only nerfed two abilities, her parry and her combo.
@:|2|CanOfCorn|And her parry got a cooldown reduction increase and daze duration decrease.
@:|0|CanOfCorn|I swear, pro play makes it so much less fun for the rest of us xD
@:|0|CanOfCorn|But to be fair, she was even dominating normal play lol
@:|0|CanOfCorn|You should try Apple or Rose next time.
@:|0|CanOfCorn|NOT SAYING BECAUSE THEY'RE TYPICAL GIRL CHARACTERS!
@:|0|CanOfCorn|Just cos they're fun and relatively easy characters to use.
@:|0|CanOfCorn|Especially when you're first learning the game.
@:|0|CanOfCorn|...
@:|0|CanOfCorn|Welp.
@:|0|CanOfCorn|My family is calling me for dinner.
@:|0|CanOfCorn|At least it's doesn't smell as spicy as last night...
@:|0|CanOfCorn|I can't handle spice, and my mom knows it.
@:|0|CanOfCorn|But my sister loves to mess with my taste buds...
@:|0|CanOfCorn|And food is food.She likes to remind me that beggars can't be choosers.
@:|0|CanOfCorn|Hit me up tomorrow to play or something :D
