@:|0|CanOfCorn|Hey <player's name>, you okay over there? xD
@:|0|CanOfCorn|Don't mind what other people say in-game...
*:|0|1|2|Those were some real toxic assholes.|Eh, I don't care~ People will be people.
@:|1|CanOfCorn|Oh yeah. Cry to Responsibility is filled with them.
@:|2|CanOfCorn|:D that's good. No use listening to people who actually know nothing about you.
@:|0|CanOfCorn|Sorry for not warning you before hand.
@:|0|CanOfCorn|It's something you kind of just... get used to :P
@:|0|CanOfCorn|You did surprisingly well, though.
@:|0|CanOfCorn|Have you played FPS games before?
*:|0|1|2|Not really. That was a first for me.|Yeah, I love first person shooters :D
@:|1|CanOfCorn|LOL You've got really great reflexes for them, though.
@:|2|CanOfCorn|Sweet! We should definitely play more sometime.
@:|0|CanOfCorn|I'm sure my friends would be down to group up again, if you're interested.
@:|0|CanOfCorn|Especially now that the new battle pass is out.
@:|0|CanOfCorn|They'll be bugging me to grind out the Flags for it xD
@:|0|CanOfCorn|I won't get any alone time for this next couple weeks...
@:|0|CanOfCorn|Ughhh... the griiind... Dx
*:|0|1|2|It'll be back next year if anything.|Right, it's the first year isn't it?
@:|1|CanOfCorn|Only if you vote on their Tweeter or Instapost!
@:|2|CanOfCorn|And hopefully not the last!|C
@:|0|CanOfCorn|I think it's gonna be really fun though :D
@:|0|CanOfCorn|Their battle passes usually give pretty good loot, too.
@:|0|CanOfCorn|We could totally get some fireworks and chill in a lobby ;P
*:|0|1|2|That'd be fun! I don't have a lot to do on July 4th anyways~|I'll actually be busy that day :( I'm sorry...
@:|1|CanOfCorn|Nice! I'm totally down :D
@:|1|CanOfCorn|I'll probably have some family stuff to do that day.
@:|1|CanOfCorn|But usually it's around dinner time, so I'm free before or after that.
@:|2|CanOfCorn|Don't worry about it!
@:|2|CanOfCorn|I usually have family stuff to do that day.
@:|2|CanOfCorn|But I figured I'd ask cos I thought it'd be fun to chill with you :P
@:|0|CanOfCorn|And my friends won't really be around...
@:|0|CanOfCorn|It'd be cool to have some solo game time with you.
@:|0|CanOfCorn|They put that new water map up as well
@:|0|CanOfCorn|So I'm probably gonna try that out more...
@:|0|CanOfCorn|What did you think of it?
*:|0|1|2|Those boats made me a little sea sick xD|The water kept glitching over the boat :\
@:|1|CanOfCorn|ME TOO!|C
@:|1|CanOfCorn|I hope they optimize it soon.
@:|1|CanOfCorn|Or at least add a "Motion Reduction" setting :P
@:|2|CanOfCorn|You know you can just fix that by tabbing out and back in, right?
@:|2|CanOfCorn|They listed it in their known issues list...
@:|2|CanOfCorn|So hopefully they fix that soon.
@:|0|CanOfCorn|I'm not meant for boats, to be honest.
@:|0|CanOfCorn|I'm happiest when my feet are planted on the ground, tyvm xD
@:|0|CanOfCorn|But, it's a cool map, so maybe I'll steal my mom's motion sickness bands
@:|0|CanOfCorn|And wear them while I play LOLOL
@:|0|CanOfCorn|Side note: I saw that they're doing a new player promotion in shop.
@:|0|CanOfCorn|So if you think you'll keep playing CtR with me, I'll buy it for you :D
*:|0|1|2|Awh, you don't have to do that :3|You're too sweet :D thanks!
@:|1|CanOfCorn|I know I don't have to lol
@:|1|CanOfCorn|But if it means you'll play more with me, then it's all good ;D
@:|2|CanOfCorn|Lol no problem :D
@:|2|CanOfCorn|It if means you'll play more with me, then I'm all for it ;P
@:|0|CanOfCorn|I'll buy it for you the next time I log in.
@:|0|CanOfCorn|So don't forget to claim it, okay? <3
@:|0|CanOfCorn|ALSO. SUPER RANDOM! But, are you a dog fan???
*:|0|1|2|Yes, definitely! I love dogs :D|Hmmm... I think I'm more of a cat person, tbh.
@:|1|CanOfCorn|Awesome! I'll admit I'm a dog lover :P|C
@:|1|CanOfCorn|I think I've had dogs all through childhood.
@:|1|CanOfCorn|Simba passed away three years ago. I grew up with him.
@:|2|CanOfCorn|Booo :P
@:|2|CanOfCorn|I mean, don't get me wrong. Cats are cool.
@:|2|CanOfCorn|But I'm super allergic to them Dx
@:|0|CanOfCorn|We just recently got a golden retriever named Bigsby.
@:|0|CanOfCorn|He's still pretty young and insanely energetic.
@:|0|CanOfCorn|He's probably been with us for just over a year.
@:|0|CanOfCorn|And his second birthday is coming up next month :P
@:|0|CanOfCorn|We just recently trained him NOT to go sprinting after every ball he sees xDD
@:|0|CanOfCorn|It was an issue when my mom first started bringing him to baseball practice lol
@:|0|CanOfCorn|Speaking of which...
@:|0|CanOfCorn|Bigsby is reaaally bugging me to go out.
@:|0|CanOfCorn|So I should probably take him on his walk before it gets too dark >.<;;
@:|0|CanOfCorn|See you tomorrow!
