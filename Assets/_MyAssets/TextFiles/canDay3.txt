@:|0|CanOfCorn|Hold on a sec, lemme dry off...
@:|0|CanOfCorn|...
@:|0|CanOfCorn|Wooo okay. All good now.
@:|0|CanOfCorn|Sorry about that xD had to help my mom in with the groceries.
@:|0|CanOfCorn|And it's still pouring rain outside...
@:|0|CanOfCorn|Not looking forward to Bigsby wanting another walk, tbh.
@:|0|CanOfCorn|But also not a fan of being stuck inside on rainy days.
@:|0|CanOfCorn|Eh, what can ya do :P
*:|0|1|2|Take an umbrella with you next time lol|Just splash in every puddle and hot shower when you're home :P
@:|1|CanOfCorn|Trueee. Although it's difficult to hold one while walking him...
@:|1|CanOfCorn|I think the sound of rain hitting the umbrella still freaks him out xD
@:|2|CanOfCorn|Only if you'll join me ;P
@:|2|CanOfCorn|For the puddle jumping, not the shower!
@:|2|CanOfCorn|Unless... 
@:|2|CanOfCorn|JK JK :P
@:|0|CanOfCorn|Okay, music back on...
@:|0|CanOfCorn|Let's see... electro playlist...
@:|0|CanOfCorn|What to listen to... Do you have any suggestions?
@:|0|CanOfCorn|I'm getting tired of all the same music on my playlist I think xD
*:|0|1|2|What about something by Evicii?|What about something by Lankin Peak?
@:|1|CanOfCorn|Ooo okay. It's been a while since I've listened to him :D|C
@:|2|CanOfCorn|Hmmm... I'm not really a rock fan, but I'll check it out.
@:|0|CanOfCorn|Alright, all situated. Sorry for leaving you mid-game!
@:|0|CanOfCorn|I felt awful about it :(
@:|0|CanOfCorn|There's a lot to take in if you're not used to baseball games.
@:|0|CanOfCorn|And especially if you're not normally a baseball fan :P
@:|0|CanOfCorn|And there are tons of names, ratings and stats to worry about...
*:|0|1|2|Yeah, it was difficult once you left :(|It's okay :D I figured it out a little and it was fun.
@:|1|CanOfCorn|We can try again if you want.
@:|1|CanOfCorn|Or we don't have to...
@:|1|CanOfCorn|Up to you :)
@:|2|CanOfCorn|I'm glad to hear that :D|C
@:|2|CanOfCorn|I was worried you'd be annoyed that I left...
@:|2|CanOfCorn|But you're smart so you got this :D
@:|0|CanOfCorn|Although, I'll admit I'm excited for these new updates they came out with.
@:|0|CanOfCorn|Not the info dump roster stuff, but the transmogs and event!
@:|0|CanOfCorn|WOOO FINALLY!
*:|0|1|2|You really like transmogs, huh?|You really like random events, huh?
@:|1|CanOfCorn|YES! I've been wanting to customize my game team to have similar jersey's to the one I wear IRL.
@:|1|CanOfCorn|I just thought it'd be cool to see...
@:|1|CanOfCorn|OTHER THAN THAT MEME PRINCESS HELMET (I'm voting on that one BTW :P)!
@:|2|CanOfCorn|YES! I think it's hilarious that they came out with just... CHAOS.
@:|2|CanOfCorn|It's literal CHAOS MODE ACTIVATED.
@:|2|CanOfCorn|YOU CAN PUNCH PEOPLE AS YOU'RE TAKING BASES LOLOLOL
@:|0|CanOfCorn|No really though.
@:|0|CanOfCorn|I LOVE baseball.
@:|0|CanOfCorn|I know it probably wouldn't happen but like.
@:|0|CanOfCorn|IF we met each other IRL on day...
@:|0|CanOfCorn|Would you come to my games and cheer me on?
*:|0|1|2|OF COURSE I WOULD!|Hmmm... As long as there's a shady spot for me to sit :P
@:|1|CanOfCorn|Awww you're too cute :P I'd appreciate that.|C
@:|1|CanOfCorn|I'd definitely win all my games with you as my cheerleader ;D
@:|1|CanOfCorn|OOF now I wish I could meet you for real xD
@:|2|CanOfCorn|LOL there are probably some trees you could sit under.
@:|2|CanOfCorn|Although, they might be situated further from the field...
@:|2|CanOfCorn|I've seen some moms bring umbrellas and chairs with them xD
@:|0|CanOfCorn|We could even go out for dinner afterwards.
@:|0|CanOfCorn|MY TREAT!
@:|0|CanOfCorn|Usually I go with my family after games.
@:|0|CanOfCorn|But if you were with me...
@:|0|CanOfCorn|Sorry not sorry, but I'd totally ditch them :P
@:|0|CanOfCorn|To celebrate my victory, of course ;D
@:|0|CanOfCorn|WITH YOU!
*:|0|1|2|Sounds like a fun time :D|But what if you don't win :<
@:|1|CanOfCorn|It would be!|C
@:|1|CanOfCorn|At least, that what I'd like to believe :P
@:|2|CanOfCorn|Even if I don't win, we'd still go out for food.
@:|2|CanOfCorn|You'll just have to console my defeated self xD
@:|0|CanOfCorn|There are a lot of restaurants near the stadium.
@:|0|CanOfCorn|With a lot of different cuisines to choose from.
@:|0|CanOfCorn|Our of curiosity, what do you like to eat?
*:|0|1|2|Something spicy!|Something savoury!
@:|1|CanOfCorn|OH NOOO! You're like my sister xD
@:|1|CanOfCorn|She LOVES spicy food.
@:|1|CanOfCorn|Now that I'm saying that again, feels like de ja vu xD
@:|2|CanOfCorn|Ooo yeah! Those are the best after a game TBH.|C
@:|2|CanOfCorn|There's a great ramen truck and a sushi-boat nearby...
@:|2|CanOfCorn|And a reaaally good Japanese curry and chicken joint.
@:|2|CanOfCorn|Typical, I know :P
@:|2|CanOfCorn|Don't judge me lol
@:|0|CanOfCorn|Ahhh, just thinking about meeting you IRL makes me excited xD
@:|0|CanOfCorn|Even though I know that's like, a long shot lol
@:|0|CanOfCorn|I know we've only been talking for a few days.
@:|0|CanOfCorn|But you're super chill and fun to be around.
@:|0|CanOfCorn|Just saying, I probably wouldn't mind being around you more ;D
@:|0|CanOfCorn|That's all you're getting out of me tonight because...
@:|0|CanOfCorn|Drumroll please...
@:|0|CanOfCorn|Once again, Bigsby is begging me for a walk xD
@:|0|CanOfCorn|So unfortunately, I have to head out I guess :(
@:|0|CanOfCorn|Hopefully I'll catch you online tomorrow :D
*:|*|1|2|3|
@:|1|CanOfCorn|Oh, and before I go...
@:|1|CanOfCorn|*Image*
@:|1|CanOfCorn|Me at my desk with my headphones :P
@:|1|CanOfCorn|In case you were curious~
@:|1|CanOfCorn|Anyways. GG and good night!
@:|2|CanOfCorn|Me and Bigsby on our walk!
@:|2|CanOfCorn|*Image*
@:|2|CanOfCorn|He's the bestest boy :D
@:|2|CanOfCorn|Anyways, I'll quit bugging you.
@:|2|CanOfCorn|Good night :D
@:|3|CanOfCorn|We talked so much about baseball today, I feel like I needed to share this:
@:|3|CanOfCorn|*Image*
@:|3|CanOfCorn|My mom snapped a good one of me while I was playing one day.
@:|3|CanOfCorn|Okay, that's it from me for now :P
@:|3|CanOfCorn|GOODNIGHT!!
