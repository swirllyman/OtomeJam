@:|0|CanOfCorn|Hold on a sec, lemme dry off...
@:|0|CanOfCorn|...
@:|0|CanOfCorn|Wooo okay. All good now.
@:|0|CanOfCorn|Sorry about that xD had to help my mom in with the groceries.
@:|0|CanOfCorn|And it's still pouring rain outside...
@:|0|CanOfCorn|Not looking forward to Bigsby wanting another walk, tbh.
@:|0|CanOfCorn|But also not a fan of being stuck inside on rainy days.
@:|0|CanOfCorn|Eh, what can ya do :P
*:|0|1|2|Take an umbrella with you next time lol|Just splash in every puddle and hot shower when you're home :P
@:|1|CanOfCorn|Trueee. Although it's difficult to hold one while walking him...
@:|1|CanOfCorn|I think the sound of rain hitting the umbrella still freaks him out xD
@:|2|CanOfCorn|Only if you'll join me ;P
@:|2|CanOfCorn|For the puddle jumping, not the shower!
@:|2|CanOfCorn|Unless... 
@:|2|CanOfCorn|JK JK :P
@:|0|CanOfCorn|Okay, music back on...
@:|0|CanOfCorn|Let's see... electro playlist...
@:|0|CanOfCorn|What to listen to... Do you have any suggestions?
@:|0|CanOfCorn|I'm getting tired of all the same music on my playlist I think xD
*:|0|1|2|What about something by Evicii?|What about something by Lankin Peak?
@:|1|CanOfCorn|Ooo okay. It's been a while since I've listened to him :D
@:|2|CanOfCorn|Hmmm... I'm not really a rock fan, but I'll check it out.
@:|0|CanOfCorn|Alright, all situated. Sorry for leaving you mid-game!
@:|0|CanOfCorn|I felt awful about it :(
@:|0|CanOfCorn|There's a lot to take in if you're not used to baseball games.
@:|0|CanOfCorn|And especially if you're not normally a baseball fan :P
@:|0|CanOfCorn|And there are tons of names, ratings and stats to worry about...
*:|0|1|2|Yeah, it was difficult once you left :(|It's okay :D I figured it out a little and it was fun.
@:|1|CanOfCorn|We can try again if you want.
@:|1|CanOfCorn|Or we don't have to...
@:|1|CanOfCorn|Up to you :)
@:|2|CanOfCorn|I'm glad to hear that :D|C
@:|2|CanOfCorn|I was worried you'd be annoyed that I left...
@:|2|CanOfCorn|But you're smart so you got this :D
@:|0|CanOfCorn|Although, I'll admit I'm excited for these new updates they came out with.
@:|0|CanOfCorn|Not the info dump roster stuff, but the transmogs and event!
@:|0|CanOfCorn|WOOO FINALLY!
*:|0|1|2|You really like transmogs, huh?|You really like random events, huh?
@:|1|CanOfCorn|YES! I've been wanting to customize my game team to have similar jersey's to the one I wear IRL.
@:|1|CanOfCorn|I just thought it'd be cool to see...
@:|1|CanOfCorn|OTHER THAN THAT MEME PRINCESS HELMET (I'm voting on that one BTW :P)!
@:|2|CanOfCorn|YES! I think it's hilarious that they came out with just... CHAOS.
@:|2|CanOfCorn|It's literal CHAOS MODE ACTIVATED.
@:|2|CanOfCorn|YOU CAN PUNCH PEOPLE AS YOU'RE TAKING BASES LOLOLOL
