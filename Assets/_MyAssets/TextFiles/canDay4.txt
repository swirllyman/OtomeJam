@:|0|CanOfCorn|Hey <pnm>!
@:|0|CanOfCorn|Sorry, I was afk. Dog doodies as usual xD
*:|0|1|2|Uh oh. Poopy accident?|Doodies? I hope you mean 'duties' and not the other xDD
@:|1|CanOfCorn|UGH YES... SOMEONE was supposed to take him out...
@:|1|CanOfCorn|Surprise surprise that she got distracted on TikTak.
@:|2|CanOfCorn|No, I meant the other -.-
@:|2|CanOfCorn|Imagine not walking a dog and going on TikTak instead...
@:|0|CanOfCorn|That's my sister for you.
@:|0|CanOfCorn|But family is family and I'm stuck with her xD
@:|0|CanOfCorn|She does have her redeeming qualities...
@:|0|CanOfCorn|SOME.
*:|0|1|2|LOL you really love your family, don't you?|LOL she really annoys you, doesn't she?
@:|1|CanOfCorn|I do :D There are ups and downs, but it's all good in the end.
@:|2|CanOfCorn|She does, but I love her anyways.
@:|0|CanOfCorn|Anyways, enough about her.
@:|0|CanOfCorn|What did you want to talk about?
@:|0|CanOfCorn|I noticed I missed a message from you earlier.
@:|0|CanOfCorn|I kind of had something I wanted to tell you as well.
*:|0|1|2|You go first.|I'll go first.
@:|1|CanOfCorn|Okay, here goes...
@:|2|CanOfCorn|Actually, would you mind if I did?
!?:|1|2|3|
@:|1|CanOfCorn|So... I've been thinking about this for the past couple days.
@:|1|CanOfCorn|And it's been really cool hanging out with you and Pocky.
@:|1|CanOfCorn|Gaming and learning more about you guys.
@:|1|CanOfCorn|You're both super chill and I'm glad we've all gotten along.
@:|1|CanOfCorn|You've been a great friend to me, and I feel like I can tell you this stuff...
@:|1|CanOfCorn|So, I've been kinda talking to Pocky on the side...
@:|1|CanOfCorn|I think I wanna ask him out.
@:|1|CanOfCorn|Or at least see if he's interested o.o
@:|1|CanOfCorn|Will you help me out?
*:|1|4|5|What are friends for, right?|Wait... But, I like you :(
@:|4|CanOfCorn|Thanks <pnm>. I just need support from a friend.
@:|4|CanOfCorn|This is my first time doing something like this...
@:|4|CanOfCorn|It's weird for me to be nervous about stuff xD
@:|4|CanOfCorn|So having a friend like you is a godsend <3
@:|5|CanOfCorn|Ohhh... Yikes...
@:|5|CanOfCorn|I'm flattered, but.
@:|5|CanOfCorn|I'm sorry, I just don't see you in that way.
@:|5|CanOfCorn|But, if you're okay with it, I'd really like to stay friends...
@:|2|CanOfCorn|So... I've been thinking about this for the past couple days.
@:|2|CanOfCorn|And it's been really cool hanging out with you.
@:|2|CanOfCorn|Gaming and having fun together.
@:|2|CanOfCorn|You're super chill and I'm glad we get along...
@:|2|CanOfCorn|At least, it seems that way to me xD
@:|2|CanOfCorn|So, I was kind of hoping that we could spend more time together.
@:|2|CanOfCorn|Maybe even voice call sometime?
@:|2|CanOfCorn|Short story: I'm interested in you.
@:|2|CanOfCorn|Maybe you'll give me the chance to learn more?
*:|2|6|7|Are you sure you want me?|I really like you too :D
@:|6|CanOfCorn|I'm fairly certain that I do :P
@:|6|CanOfCorn|But there's no way of really finding that out
@:|6|CanOfCorn|Unless we spend more time together, right?
@:|6|CanOfCorn|You already know I'm down ;D
@:|7|CanOfCorn|Awesome :D I'm happy to hear that!
@:|7|CanOfCorn|There's a lot I want to learn about you...
@:|7|CanOfCorn|And I haven't even seen a proper picture of you yet.
@:|7|CanOfCorn|So you know I'll be bugging you for that soon ;D
@:|3|CanOfCorn|So... I've been thinking about you for the past couple days.
@:|3|CanOfCorn|A LOT.
@:|3|CanOfCorn|Like, so much more than I've ever thought about a person before.
@:|3|CanOfCorn|And, I know it's only been a few days that we've known each other...
@:|3|CanOfCorn|But, I feel like we mix really well together.
@:|3|CanOfCorn|And you're super chill, smart and sweet.
@:|3|CanOfCorn|And hella fun to be around.
@:|3|CanOfCorn|...
@:|3|CanOfCorn|UGH WHY AM I CHOOSING NOW TO BE NERVOUS XD
@:|3|CanOfCorn|Look, what I'm trying to say is
@:|3|CanOfCorn|I REALLY like you.
@:|3|CanOfCorn|And I kinda wanna turn this into something.
@:|3|CanOfCorn|No, hrm... c'mon Izuki, spit it out...
@:|3|CanOfCorn|I--
@:|3|CanOfCorn|Can I be your boyfriend?
*:|3|8|9|YES! Of course :D|Are you sure? We've only known each other a few days...
@:|8|PlayerName|I really like you too <3
@:|8|CanOfCorn|You do?!
@:|8|CanOfCorn|I was hoping you'd say that <333
@:|8|CanOfCorn|Man, I'm basically shaking after that confession xDD
@:|9|CanOfCorn|I'm 100% certain.
@:|9|CanOfCorn|I haven't clicked like this with anyone in a while.
@:|9|CanOfCorn|Not like I was going into this thinking, "I'm gonna date you."
@:|9|CanOfCorn|But I'm happy it turned out that way :P
