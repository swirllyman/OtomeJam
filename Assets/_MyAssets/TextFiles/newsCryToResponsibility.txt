~:3|0|Sound: Sometimes you can still hear your boat once you’ve docked on an island. We like to call them ghost ships :P"

~:4|0|
~:4|0|Teams are seeded according to the average team rank, and each player is given a UniLeague rank based on where they are in ranked queue. We’re hoping this will create overall better and more fair matchups (unless you’re bad and you queue with all your god friends! But that’s on you :P). Climb the bracket and see how far you can go. Win awesome UniLeague prizes, like Random Transmog Chests or Avi Icons.

~:4|0|We understand that because this is a new feature, there will be bugs and issues to expect. We’d like to thank the community in advance for helping with the Beta testing of UniLeague, and promise that we will do our best to address any issues that come up in this weekend’s first rendition, as well as every one after. Trust us, it’ll only get better from here.
