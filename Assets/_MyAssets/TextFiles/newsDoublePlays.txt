Turn these in to your Team Manager in the Dugout to create new looks for your team! Transmogs are also available in the game store for medals. Win games to obtain medals and turn them in for some cool new hats, jackets, shoes, and bats.

~:5|0|To celebrate, we’re releasing an all-new 10 year event, which will run til the end of this year (Dec 31, 2021). Introducing our Random Event game mode! This is completely for fun -- run backwards, moonwalk or crab walk to the bases; or throw punches and curse at your least favorite players! Anything is possible, just try out some INTeresting word inputs when you first load into the lobby to gain access to secret unlockables (If you pay attention to our news updates, we’ll be dropping more clues to some of these words through our posts ;D). Share your inputs with the community in our Harmocord server until you’ve unlocked them all! A new Gallery will update and help you keep track of your progress in game.
