~:1|0|Last year's winner, FelixFelizes was the crowd favorite to win again this year, but it seems the pandemic did more to stunt his progress than help it. He made a clutch comback with a combo modifier of 789x in the third song, coming in second place in overall score.
~:1|0|In third, last year’s quarterfinalist, SOOSIN, who actually had to forfeit the semi’s due to a food allergy! Guess she’s back this year for a round two shot at the title.
~:1|0|Tune in again this weekend to watch the semi-finals and find out who will be facing against HungryMan in this year’s finals!"

~:2|0|Introducing new customizable UI’s! As simple as using any design software and plugging it in to our wizard to implement into your client. Our devs were also kind enough to make a video (click here for awesome teaching vid by our equally awesome devs) for those of you who are beginners, but would like to customize on your own.
~:2|0|We also have a betaMarket where you can trade or giveaway UI designs with/to other Flows! Users.

Save and upvote your favorites!
Last year, we talked about creating hangout areas for friends. Well, they’re finally coming! Our ‘After Party’ lobbies will allow you to hangout with friends in public or private servers, and queue up selected music from your rhythm maps. With this, we’re releasing all new CUSTOMIZABLE AVATARS. Play ranked songs to earn points for the new Avatar Shop and customize your avatar with a new look before you pop into After Party! We’ll be releasing a beta version of this before full release, for feedback and bug testing.
