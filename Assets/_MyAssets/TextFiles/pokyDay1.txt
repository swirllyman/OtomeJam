@:|0|PockyDaze|Yo, feel free to mute the server. They post a lot, and you'll get bombarded with notifications. 
@:|0|PockyDaze|They share a lot of links and songs on there, so you can play everyone's beat maps. 
*:|0|1|2|I saw you posted a few of your own! They were pretty difficult, but fun.|Yeah, it was a little overwhelming.
@:|1|PockyDaze|You tried them out? Damn, I definitely made that for intermediate players. I'm impressed.|P
@:|2|PockyDaze|It doesn't take long to catch up, but the best part is playing everyone's maps. 
@:|0|PockyDaze|BTW, did you see the News Bot?
@:|0|PockyDaze|They update pretty regularly, so I check it twice a day. 
@:|0|PockyDaze|I was just looking at the news, and I can't believe BOBAbuser released a new map!
@:|0|PockyDaze|It's pretty poppy, if that's your kind of music.
*:|0|1|2|I'll check it out! If you're excited, it must be good.|Poppy? Hm... maybe I'll try it.
@:|1|PockyDaze|It's fantastic! 
@:|2|PockyDaze|Even if you don't, I still say you should try it out. It's clean.
@:|0|PockyDaze|I'm actually working on another rhythm map right now. 
@:|0|PockyDaze|It's a bit tricky to get set-up, because I want to play with the speed.
@:|0|PockyDaze|It's going to be messy for even the best players >:3
@:|0|PockyDaze|Next thing you know, you're gonna be seeing my name in the News.
@:|0|PockyDaze|If you're going to try it out, you'll have to get gud. 
*:|0|1|2|I'm sure I can handle it.|Wow! Share it when you finish it.
@:|1|PockyDaze|Gutsy... or foollish. lol
@:|2|PockyDaze|Hell yeah, when I finish it I'll send it your way. You can be my first tester. 
@:|0|PockyDaze|You're probably not super into it just yet, but there're competitions and finals in Flows.
@:|0|PockyDaze|You might've seen some of their names in the leaderboards when you open the game up.
@:|0|PockyDaze|I think FelixFelizes is going to kick butt! His skill is unmatched!
*:|0|1|2|What about HungryMan? He seems like he's pretty good.|What about SOOSIN? She's talented.
@:|1|PockyDaze|Yeah, he is pretty good, but he's also a newbie, kinda like you.|P
@:|1|PockyDaze|Definitely keep an eye on him, but he's too fresh to beat seasoned veterans. :3
@:|1|PockyDaze|It'd take something amazing for him to come out on top. 
@:|2|PockyDaze|Doing your research, huh? 
@:|2|PockyDaze|She's really really good. I expect her to do well as long as she doesn't eat any pineapples this year.
@:|2|PockyDaze|Those things'll kill ya. XP
@:|0|PockyDaze|But yeah, I'll be watching that in a few minutes. 
@:|0|PockyDaze|If I'm afk, that's what I'm doing, haha. 
@:|0|PockyDaze|You're probably busy, but if you can watch it, you'll learn how to play better. 
@:|0|PockyDaze|That's what I did when I was starting out. 
@:|0|PockyDaze|You just watch what pros are doing and try to copy it. 
*:|0|1|2|Good advice. I'll have to watch some VODs since I'm about to sit down for dinner.|Guess even you had to start somewhere, huh?
@:|1|PockyDaze|VODs are good, if you can find high quality ones.
@:|1|PockyDaze|There are good ones on YouView. I'll send you some links later.
@:|1|PockyDaze|Unfortunately, they never do non-commentary VODs for Finals. So if you hate people talking over the music, it'll be irritating. XD
@:|2|PockyDaze|Of course I did!
@:|2|PockyDaze|It's not like I was just born this amazing...
@:|2|PockyDaze|...well, maybe I was. X3 jk jk
@:|0|PockyDaze|Lemme pull up the stream real quick...
@:|0|PockyDaze|HOLD UP.
@:|0|PockyDaze|There's no way. 
@:|0|PockyDaze|I can't believe it!
*:|0|1|2|HungryMan!|FelixFelizes!
@:|1|PockyDaze|He got a perfect FULL COMBO.|P
@:|1|PockyDaze|That's almost impossible to do, and he managed it! 
@:|2|PockyDaze|Well, yeah. I can't believe he came in second.
@:|2|PockyDaze|But HungryMan did that whole underdog thing and kicked butt!
@:|0|PockyDaze|That song is really difficult too. 
@:|0|PockyDaze|I've only managed a perfect on a couple of songs, and I have to be really in the zone.
@:|0|PockyDaze|Although, he looked like he was going to burst a blood vessel about halfway through the song.
@:|0|PockyDaze|Man, I'm so on edge now... 
@:|0|PockyDaze|I'm feeling really motivated to get that map done.
@:|0|PockyDaze|Might spend the rest of the night on it. 
@:|0|PockyDaze|I'm so hyped!
*:|0|1|2|You're really getting into this!|Don't bust a blood vessel!
@:|1|PockyDaze|Yeah! Watching someone get a perfect makes me want to make this song harder.
@:|1|PockyDaze|Really throw in some beats that throw off a normal gamer.
@:|1|PockyDaze|HungryMan will struggle with this one!
@:|2|PockyDaze|Hah! I won't.
@:|2|PockyDaze|Not going to be that focused on it anyway.
@:|2|PockyDaze|If I finish it tonight, I'll send it over.
@:|0|PockyDaze|I should head off and get to work on this. 
@:|0|PockyDaze|If I don't get started now, I might be up alllllll night, haha. 
@:|0|PockyDaze|CanOfCorn will get mad at me if I'm not up to play.
@:|0|PockyDaze|If I don't wake up in time, tell him I'll be late, okay? 
*:|*|1|2|3|
@:|1|PockyDaze|Also, I don't take many pics, but...
@:|1|PockyDaze|*Image*
@:|1|PockyDaze|I thought it'd be fun to take a quick selfie. 
@:|1|PockyDaze|Think it could be my new profile picture?
@:|1|PockyDaze|...nevermind. I like my old one more. XD
@:|2|PockyDaze|Check out Jiji! Look at her face. <3
@:|2|PockyDaze|*Image*
@:|2|PockyDaze|This cat is so talkative.
@:|2|PockyDaze|Maybe you can hear her when we're on chat.
@:|2|PockyDaze|Anyway, I'm passing out. Night!
@:|3|PockyDaze|I bet you wouldn't expect to see this, but...
@:|3|PockyDaze|*Image*
@:|3|PockyDaze|Like I said, I like to cosplay. And I felt pretty good about this one.
@:|3|PockyDaze|Oh, and you can see my giant Teddy Bear too.
@:|3|PockyDaze|Of course he has a name. 
@:|3|PockyDaze|It's Sir Bearington III. And you have to say it with as posh an accent as you can.
@:|3|PockyDaze|Alright, lol. Night.
